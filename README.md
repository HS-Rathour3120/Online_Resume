# Sample_Resume_Template
Portfolio website is like online résumé. Potential clients and hiring managers can easily find me online and check my previous projects and skills.
As a developer, I need an online presence. With my own portfolio website, it's live on your own domain online. And people can easily find me when they search my name on a search engine like Google, provided they put the right things in place when it comes to SEO.
In this Project ,I created each and every section which we write in resume.
As,this is my beginner level Project ,So the functionality part was remaining ,which I would complete after getting Command over JavaScript.
